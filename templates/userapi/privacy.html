                        <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how We use such technologies and how You can refuse certain cookies is set out in Our Cookie Policy.</p>
                        <h2>Is Your Information Transferred Internationally?</h2>
                        <p>We may transfer, store, and process Your information in countries other than Your own.</p>
                        <p>Our servers are located in the USA and Serbia.

                        <p>If You are a resident of the European Economic Area, then these countries may not have data protection or other laws as comprehensive as those in Your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect Your personal information following this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
                        <p><b>European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses:</b></p>
                        <p>Such measures implement the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between Our group companies and between Us and Our third-party providers, which require all such recipients to protect the personal information that they process from the EEA under European data protection laws. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with Our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>
                        <h2>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
                        <p>We keep Your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>
                        <p>We will only keep Your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this Policy will require Us keeping Your personal information for longer than 2 years.</p>
                        <p>When We have no ongoing legitimate business need to process Your personal information, We will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because Your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then We will securely store Your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
                        <h2>How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
                        <p>We aim to protect Your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
                        <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information We process. However, please also remember that We cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although We will do Our best to protect Your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from Our Sites is at Your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>
                        <h2>Do We Collect Information From Minors?</h2>
                        <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Sites, You represent that You are at least 18 or that You are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Sites. If We learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, We will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from Our records. If You become aware of any data We have collected from children under the age of 18, please contact Us.</p>
                        <h2>What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>
                        <p>In some regions (like the European Economic Area), You have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of Your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of Your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, You may also have the right to object to the processing of Your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request following applicable data protection laws.</p>
                        <p>If We are relying on Your consent to process Your personal information, You have the right to withdraw Your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>If You are a resident of the European Economic Area and You believe We are unlawfully processing Your personal information, You also have the right to complain to Your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/612080">here.</a>
                        <p><b>Cookies and similar technologies:</b> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If You prefer, You can usually choose to set Your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If You choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of Our Sites. To opt-out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on Our Sites visit <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/">here</a>.</p>
                        <h2>Controls For Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
                        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting You can activate to signal Your privacy preference not to have data about Your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, We do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates Your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that We must follow in the future, We will inform You about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <h2>Do California Residents Have Specific Privacy Rights?</h2>
                        <p>If You are a resident of California, You are granted specific rights regarding access to Your personal information.</p>
                        <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits Our users who are California residents to request and obtain from Us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) We disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which We shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If You are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit Your request in writing to Us using the contact information provided below.</p>
                        <p>If You are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Sites, You have the right to request the removal of unwanted data that You publicly post on the Sites. To request the removal of such data, please contact Us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with Your Account and a statement that You reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Sites, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from Our systems.</p>
