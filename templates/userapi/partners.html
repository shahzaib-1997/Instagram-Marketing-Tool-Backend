                        <h2>What is MassNova</h2>
                        <p><b>MassNova</b> is a Social Media marketing solution for automated Organic Growth on Instagram.</p>
                        <h2>How does MassNova work</h2>
                        <p>By automating your account on Instagram (primarily follow and unfollow interactions), we make sure that you're getting followbacks only from real profiles that will actually engage with your content.</p>
                        <p>Once the Instagram account is connected to the MassNova growth system, there are a couple of steps that need to be done in order to see results:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Target other Instagram accounts or hashtags</li>
                            <li>Wait for a 2-5 day warmup period to end</li>
                            <li>After the warmup, your account will start doing interactions with other profiles</li>
                            <li>Keep an eye on your analytics and optimize your targeting for even more growth.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>For more information about our growth system please refer to our <a href={% url "userapi:how" %}>How it Works</a>, <a href={% url "userapi:pricing" %}>Pricing</a>, and <a href={% url "userapi:features" %}>Features</a> pages.</p>
