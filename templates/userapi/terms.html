                        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
                        <p>The Service and its original content (excluding Content provided by You or other users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of the Company and its licensors.</p>
                        <p>The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the Country and foreign countries.</p>
                        <p>Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of the Company.</p>
                        <h2>Service Delivery</h2>
                        <p>The Service focuses on bringing the attention of real users to Your Instagram Account with goals that may include increasing followers and followers’ engagement. The expected quantity and/or quality of followers and followers’ engagement is not guaranteed to You in any way. Regardless of any perceived representation to the contrary, the Company in no way guarantees specific results to the Customer. You understand that You are paying Us for our effort to generate results, but that results are never guaranteed as there are many factors involved, some of which are out of Our control. Moreover, We cannot protect You from spam, fake, or inactive followers, as it is not always possible to avoid them. It is understood that the Company has no control over Instagram if they decide to change its platform.</p>
                        <p>We cannot guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted, or error-free operability of the services.</p>
                        <p>It is the sole responsibility of the Customer to provide updated passwords to the Company during their use of the Service. Any downtime of service concerning a Customer not providing their current password will not result in any payment reimbursement for that period.</p>
                        <p>The company reserves the right to refuse to provide the Service to anyone for any reason and the right to modify or discontinue the Service (or any part or content thereof) without notice at any time.</p>
                        <p>Prices of the Service are subject to change without notice. The Company will always try to contact its Customers prior to any pricing changes. Existing billing agreements will not be affected.</p>
                        <p>The Company shall not be liable to the Customer or any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service.</p>
                        <h2>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
                        <p>The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, concerning the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of the course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems, or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error-free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
                        <h2>Termination</h2>
                        <p>We may terminate or suspend Your Account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.</p>
                        <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately. If You wish to terminate Your Account, You may simply discontinue using the Service by canceling Your subscription (not just turning off the interactions on Your used dashboard).</p>
                        <h2>The Customer Is Bound To Contract (Subscription) Periods</h2>
                        <p>These Terms remain in effect until the end of the Customer's billing cycle. The Customer is entitled to cancel their subscription with the Company without given reason by contacting the Company, as outlined in the "Contact Us" section of this document, at least 24 hours before the end of the Customer's current billing cycle. Otherwise, the Customer is obliged to fulfill the last month of the billing prior to cancellation. Please note that pausing an Account by turning off the interactions manually on Your user dashboard does not cancel the subscription and related charges.</p>
                        <h2>The Customer Agrees To the Limitation Of Liability</h2>
                        <p>The Company may not be held liable for any potential damages incurred. In no event will the Company have any liability to the other for lost profit, revenue, or any circumstantial, incidental, consequential, punitive, or other forms of damages however they may have been caused, whether in contract or under any other theoretical circumstance of liability and regardless of whether the Client has been advised of the possibility of the aforementioned damages. The Client will have no financial liability to the Company for a breach of these Terms.</p>
                        <h2>The Customer Agrees To The Refund Policy As Described</h2>
                        <h3><u>Refund requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The refund policy as described in the Terms does not serve as a guarantee of any payment reimbursement.</u></h3>
                        <p>You agree to contact the Company for a refund if necessary. The Company reserves the right to issue a full, partial, or prorated refund based on its discretion. You also agree not to file any fraudulent claim to chargeback or dispute charges against the Company. In the event that the Service can no longer be provided, the Company reserves the right to deny any payment reimbursement and discontinue the Service at any time. Please be advised growth is relative, and while We will strive to provide the best results, these may vary depending on Account quality, content, niche, etc. The quantity and quality of followers, engagement, or any other form of growth are not guaranteed.</p>
                        <p>If Your refund is approved and within the Terms, it will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to Your original method of payment within 3-10 business days.</p>
                        <p>When subscribing to our Service, the Customer agrees to pay and take responsibility for all charges made following the chosen plan and these Terms.</p>
                        <h3>Quarterly and (Semi)Yearly Plan Subscriptions</h3>
                        <p>Yearly, quarterly, and other plans that are charged for several months up-front are offered at a significant discount, and as such, are non-refundable. For untimely cancellations and in extreme circumstances, Your remaining subscription time can be converted into non-refundable credits at the Company's sole discretion. These credits can be transferred to any other subscription on the Customer's Account. Should a refund for a yearly, quarterly, or other plan subscription be provided at the discretion of the Company, the Company may offer only a partial refund following the remaining time on the Subscription minus the discount offered on the price.</p>
                        <h3>Loss Of Access To Service</h3>
                        <p>Refunds for any subscription type due to loss of access to a Service related to Instagram/TikTok will be honored at the sole discretion of the Company. This may include loss of access to an Account and loss of access to features within a social media app.</p>
                        <h3>Paused Interactions or Account is Disconnected</h3>
                        <p>Pausing an Account by turning off the interactions manually on Your user dashboard does not cancel the subscription and related charges. The pause functionality serves to temporarily stop activity on Your Account. It does not pause the subscription itself, meaning it does not affect the time until the subscription is renewed or the billing date. We do not credit additional days for the paused period.</p>
                        <p>It is the sole responsibility of the Customer to ensure that their social media Account stays connected to the Service. The Company will not offer any reimbursement or compensation for downtime that resulted from a failure to stay connected to the Service. Any downtime of Service in relation to a client not providing their current password will not result in any payment reimbursement for that period.</p>
                        <h3>Service Level</h3>
                        <p>While the Company strives and uses its resources to offer the highest level of Service to the Customer, it is not possible to guarantee any specific level of performance. The Service level is limited by various factors including, but not limited to, the Customer's user dashboard configuration, targeting settings, and connection status, as well as general factors such as their social media Account history, Trust Score, and overall posting and browsing habits. As such, performance varies greatly depending on these factors, and refunds cannot be issued based on Service Level concerns.</p>
                        <h3>Recurring Subscription Billing Agreement</h3>
                        <p>Should a refund request be submitted by the Customer due to the Customer not being aware of a recurring subscription, the Company can fulfill said requests at its sole discretion. It is the responsibility of the Customer to understand the nature of their Billing Agreement, which is expressly mentioned in the Pricing section of the Website, as well as during the checkout process of the Company's designated payment provider.</p>
                        <h3>Unexpected Service</h3>
                        <p>Should the Customer request a refund on the basis that the service is not as expected, the Company can fulfill such refund requests at its sole discretion and only within 30 days of the initial purchase. The Company is under no obligation to fulfill refund requests in the event the Customer claims service is not as expected. The Customer is expected to read and acknowledge the nature of the Service and all of its features, as well as to get familiar with the Terms and Privacy Policy before purchasing the service. We do not offer refunds based on Customers not being informed of the service functionality and results, as described in these Terms. If You have any additional questions about a specific feature, functionality, or company policy please contact the Company prior to the purchase.</p>
                        <h3>Untimely Cancellation</h3>
                        <p>When canceling a subscription, the Company will continue to provide the Service until the end of the current billing cycle. The Company is not obligated to offer any form of compensation or reimbursement should the Customer choose to cancel their subscription and continue using the Service until the end of their current billing cycle.
                            Should the Customer cancel the subscription with the Company in an untimely fashion, the Company can fulfill said refund request at its sole discretion. In most instances, the Customer is offered Services for the rest of the paid month. Should an untimely cancellation occur within a reasonable timeframe as determined by the Company, the Customer may be eligible for a refund. If You have contacted us at least 24h before Your next billing date and still got charged, please contact Us back so We can process the refund.</p>
                        <h3>Inactivity</h3>
                        <p>The Service works within the limits set by Instagram for every specific Account, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the Account history, Trust Score, and overall posting and browsing habits. As such, it is impossible to guarantee a minimum interaction uptime for every specific Account. While the Company cannot issue a refund for something outside of Our control, We want to make sure every Customer has an excellent user experience. In case of downtime, Your subscription will be extended or promotional credits will be issued.</p>
                        <p>Should the Customer request a refund due to account inactivity as caused by technical issues, the Company may issue a refund at its sole discretion. Refunds in such instances are typically fulfilled when the issue cannot be solved within a reasonable timeframe as determined by the Company. As such, refund requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                        <h3>Double Charge</h3>
                        <p>Should the Customer enter an additional billing agreement with the Company that renders the first billing agreement obsolete, the Customer may be double-charged by mistake. In such instances, the Company shall always endeavor to refund the Customer in a reasonable timeframe as determined by the Company.</p>
                        <h2>Disputes Resolution</h2>
                        <p>If You have any concerns or disputes about the Service, You agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting the Company.</p>
                        <h2>Changes to the Terms and Conditions and Website information</h2>
                        <p>We reserve the right, at Our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms and the content of the Website, including prices, at any time. </p>
                        <p>By continuing to access or use Our Service after those revisions become effective, You agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If You do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please stop using the Website and the Service.</p>
                        <h2>Your Feedback to Us</h2>
                        <p>You assign all rights, titles, and interests in any Feedback You provide the Company. If for any reason such assignment is ineffective, You agree to grant the Company a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide right and license to use, reproduce, disclose, sub-license, distribute, modify and exploit such Feedback without restriction.</p>
